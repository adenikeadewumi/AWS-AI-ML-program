# ðŸŒ¼ Flower Image Classifier with Deep Learning

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
This project demonstrates the process of building an **image classification model** using **deep learning** in **PyTorch**.  
The goal is to train a model that can accurately **identify flower species** from images.  

The project is divided into two parts:
1. **Development Notebook** â€“ Building and training the deep learning model using Jupyter Notebook.  
2. **Command Line Application** â€“ Converting the notebook logic into Python scripts (`train.py` and `predict.py`) for easy deployment and use.

This project was completed as part of the **AWS AI & Machine Learning Scholarship Program**.

## ðŸ§  Key Objectives
- Apply **transfer learning** using a pretrained CNN such as VGG16.
- Implement **data augmentation** and **normalization** to improve model generalization.
- Build a **custom feedforward classifier** on top of a pretrained network.
- Train and evaluate the model on a flower dataset.
- Develop a **command-line tool** for training and predicting flower classes.
- Save and load model **checkpoints** for reuse.
