# üèôÔ∏è Landmark Classification and Tagging with Deep Learning

This project applies **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to automatically classify world landmarks in photos. It is a task inspired by real-world problems in **photo storage and sharing platforms**. When images lack GPS or metadata, this model predicts the landmark location based solely on the visual features in the image.

## üìñ Project Overview

Photo sharing and storage platforms often rely on metadata (like GPS coordinates) to organize and tag photos. However, many images lack this information due to device limitations or privacy settings.  
To address this, the project aims to build a **Landmark Classifier** that can:

- Identify landmarks in images using deep learning.
- Predict the most likely location or landmark class.
- Automatically tag or organize photos based on predictions.

The project represents a real-world application of **computer vision** and **machine learning deployment**, forming part of the AWS AI & ML Scholarship learning path.
