# üßÅ Build a Machine Learning Workflow for Scones Unlimited on Amazon SageMaker

This project is part of the **Udacity AWS Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program**.

---

## üß† Project Overview

In this project, I built and deployed an **image classification model** using **Amazon SageMaker** to help a fictional logistics company, **Scones Unlimited**, identify the type of vehicle their delivery drivers use, specifically, whether it‚Äôs a **bicycle** or a **motorcycle**.

Image classification models are an essential part of **computer vision**, widely used in industries ranging from **autonomous vehicles** and **augmented reality** to **eCommerce** and **diagnostic medicine**. For Scones Unlimited, this model enables smarter logistics management and improved operational efficiency.

By automatically identifying drivers‚Äô vehicles, the company can:
- Assign nearby orders to **bicyclists** for quicker delivery.
- Assign longer routes to **motorcyclists** for better efficiency.
- Optimize routing, safety, and delivery speed.
- Scale operations with automated ML-driven decision-making.

## üöÄ Project Steps Overview

### **Step 1: Data Staging**
- Collected and prepared the dataset of vehicle images.
- Uploaded data to **Amazon S3** for accessibility by SageMaker.
- Ensured images were properly labeled as *bicycle* or *motorcycle*.

### **Step 2: Model Training and Deployment**
- Built and trained a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for binary classification.
- Used **SageMaker built-in training jobs** for model experimentation.
- Deployed the trained model as a **real-time inference endpoint**.

### **Step 3: Lambda Functions and Step Function Workflow**
- Created **AWS Lambda functions** to:
  - Invoke the SageMaker model endpoint.
  - Process inference results and trigger workflow steps.
- Designed an **AWS Step Functions workflow** to coordinate:
  - Image input ‚Üí Model prediction ‚Üí Result processing ‚Üí Output.

### **Step 4: Testing and Evaluation**
- Validated endpoint predictions with a held-out test set.
- Evaluated model accuracy and response latency.
- Confirmed the end-to-end pipeline functioned correctly.

### **Step 5: Optional Challenge**
- Explored additional optimizations for scalability and monitoring.
- Implemented optional CloudWatch metrics for endpoint health and performance.

### **Step 6: Cleanup Cloud Resources**
- Deleted deployed endpoints, Step Functions, and S3 objects to avoid unnecessary costs.
