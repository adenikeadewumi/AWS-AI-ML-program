# ðŸ”¢ Handwritten Digit Classifier with PyTorch

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a **handwritten digit classifier** using **PyTorch** and the **MNIST dataset**.  
Two models were explored:
1. A **neural network built from scratch**.  
2. A **pretrained model** fine-tuned on the same dataset.

The goal was to achieve at least **90% accuracy** on the test set while demonstrating key deep-learning skills such as model building, training loops, evaluation, and model saving.

## ðŸ§  Learning Objectives
- Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset using `torchvision.datasets`.
- Visualize and understand the datasetâ€™s structure and features.
- Build and train a neural network from scratch using PyTorch.
- Experiment with **pretrained models** and compare performance.
- Tune hyperparameters (learning rate, hidden units, epochs).
- Evaluate and save the trained model for future use.
